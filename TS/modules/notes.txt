TypeScript supports modules that allows us to share code between files 
it also allows us to control the output that it generates 

if we don't use the export keyword anywhere, TS just considers all of our code to be in the same scope(the global scope)
so we will have trouble to write variable/function of same name in different file.

The moment we add export keyword somewhere, TS will now assume we work in a module

--> Any JS file that has an export or top level await is considered a module
